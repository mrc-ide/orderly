# Dependencies between packets

One of the core aims of `orderly` is to allow collaborative analysis; to
do this the end of one piece of work is an input for another piece of
work, perhaps someone else’s. To make this work in practice, one
`orderly` report can “depend” on some completed packet (or several
completed packets) in order to pull in files as inputs.

There are two levels that it is useful to think about dependencies:

- At the level of the source report, as an instruction about what we
  **intend** to depend on; this may or may not be satisfiable
- At the level of a completed packet, as a record about what **was**
  depended on

This perspective differs somewhat from workflow managers where it is
common to talk about “outdated dependencies” and have some single idea
of an end result that a chain of dependencies builds up to.

This vignette walks through some of the practical issues around creating
and working with dependencies between reports, starting from simple
cases (these will be familiar to users of `orderly1`) through to more
advanced cases. We then cover how to interrogate the dependency graph
and our ideas for extending this in future, and some practical issues
around how dependencies interact with different locations (there is some
overlap here with
[`vignette("collaboration")`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/articles/collaboration.md),
which we will highlight).

``` r
library(orderly)
```

## Using dependencies

Here, we show how to practically use dependencies in a few common
scenarios of increasing complexity. The code examples are purposefully
too-simple in order to keep the presentation straightforward, see the
end of this document for a discussion of how complex these pieces of
code might “optimally” be.

### Basic use

The primary mechanism for using dependencies is to call
[`orderly_dependency()`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/reference/orderly_dependency.md)
from within an `orderly` file; this finds a suitable completed packet
and copies files that are found from within that packet into your
current report.

    ## src
    ## ├── analysis
    ## │   └── analysis.R
    ## └── data
    ##     ├── data.R
    ##     └── data.csv

and `src/analysis/analysis.R` contains:

``` r
orderly_dependency("data", "latest()", "data.rds")
d <- readRDS("data.rds")
png("analysis.png")
plot(y ~ x, d)
dev.off()
```

Here, we’ve used
[`orderly_dependency()`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/reference/orderly_dependency.md)
to pull in the file `data.rds` from the most recent version (`latest()`)
of the `data` packet, then we’ve used that file as normal to make a
plot, which we’ve saved as `analysis.png` (this is very similar to the
example from
[`vignette("introduction")`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/articles/introduction.md),
to get us started).

``` r
id1 <- orderly_run("data")
## ℹ Starting packet 'data' `20251219-120025-301f0cde` at 2025-12-19 12:00:25.19261
## > d <- read.csv("data.csv")
## > d$z <- resid(lm(y ~ x, d))
## > saveRDS(d, "data.rds")
## ✔ Finished running data.R
## ℹ Finished 20251219-120025-301f0cde at 2025-12-19 12:00:25.230491 (0.03788161 secs)
id2 <- orderly_run("analysis")
## ℹ Starting packet 'analysis' `20251219-120025-43c5001d` at 2025-12-19 12:00:25.269285
## > orderly_dependency("data", "latest()", "data.rds")
## ℹ Depending on data @ `20251219-120025-301f0cde` (via latest(name == "data"))
## > d <- readRDS("data.rds")
## > png("analysis.png")
## > plot(y ~ x, d)
## > dev.off()
## agg_png 
##       2
## ✔ Finished running analysis.R
## ℹ Finished 20251219-120025-43c5001d at 2025-12-19 12:00:25.355947 (0.08666182 secs)
```

When we look at the metadata for the packet created from the `analysis`
report, we can see it has used `20251219-120025-301f0cde` as its
dependency:

``` r
orderly_metadata(id2)$depends
##                     packet                  query        files
## 1 20251219-120025-301f0cde latest(name == "data") data.rds....
```

(indeed it had to, there is only one copy of the `data` packet to pick
from).

### Filtering candidates by parameters

In the above example, our query was as simple as it could be — the most
recently created packet with the name `data`. One common pattern we see
is that an analysis might have a parameter (for example a country name)
and a downstream analysis might share that parameter and want to pull in
data for a country.

    ## src
    ## ├── analysis
    ## │   └── analysis.R
    ## └── data
    ##     └── data.R

with `src/data/data.R` containing:

``` r
pars <- orderly_parameters(cyl = NULL)
d <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl == pars$cyl, ]
saveRDS(d, "data.rds")
```

We can run this for several values of `cyl`:

``` r
orderly_run("data", list(cyl = 4))
## ℹ Starting packet 'data' `20251219-120025-ba2aefbe` at 2025-12-19 12:00:25.731919

## [1] "20251219-120025-d8e20296"
```

Our follow-on analysis contains:

``` r
pars <- orderly_parameters(cyl = NULL)
orderly_dependency(
  "data",
  "latest(parameter:cyl == this:cyl)",
  "data.rds")
d <- readRDS("data.rds")
png("analysis.png")
plot(mpg ~ disp, d)
dev.off()
```

Here the query `latest(parameter:cyl == this:cyl)` says “find the most
recent packet where it’s parameter”cyl” (`parameter:cyl`) is the same as
the parameter in the currently running report (`this:cyl`).

``` r
orderly_run("analysis", list(cyl = 4))

## [1] "20251219-120026-092ab356"
```

### Interpreting errors

If your query fails to resolve a candidate it will error:

``` r
orderly_run("analysis", list(cyl = 9000))
## ℹ Starting packet 'analysis' `20251219-120026-3148f29b` at 2025-12-19 12:00:26.197025
## ℹ Parameters:
## • cyl: 9000
## > pars <- orderly_parameters(cyl = NULL)
## > orderly_dependency(
## +   "data",
## +   "latest(parameter:cyl == this:cyl)",
## +   "data.rds")
## ✖ Error running analysis.R
## ℹ Finished 20251219-120026-3148f29b at 2025-12-19 12:00:26.263809 (0.06678367 secs)
## Error in `orderly_run()`:
## ! Failed to run report
## Caused by error in `outpack_packet_use_dependency()`:
## ! Failed to find packet for query 'latest(parameter:cyl == this:cyl &&
##   name == "data")'
## ℹ See 'rlang::last_error()$explanation' for details
```

The error message here tries to be fairly self explanatory; we have
failed to find a packet that satisfies our
query`latest(parameter:cyl == this:cyl && name == "data")`; note that
the report name `data` has become part of this query, so there are two
conditions being matched on.

The error suggests running `rlang::last_error()$explanation` for more
information, which we can do:

``` r
rlang::last_error()$explanation
## Evaluated query: 'latest(A && B)' and found 0 packets
## • A (parameter:cyl == this:cyl): 0 packets
## 
## • B (name == "data"): 3 packets
```

This is an `orderly_query_explain` object, which tries to come up with
reasons why your query might not have matched; we’ll expand this in the
future so let us know what you might like to see.

This tells you that your query can be decomposed into two subqueries `A`
(the match against the parameter `cyl` being 9000), which matched no
packets and `B` (the match against the packet name being `data`), which
matched 3 packets. If each subquery matched packets but some *pairs*
don’t then it will try and guide you towards problematic pairs.

You can also ask `orderly` to explain any query for you:

``` r
orderly_query_explain(
  quote(latest(parameter:cyl == 9000)), name = "data")
## Evaluated query: 'latest(A && B)' and found 0 packets
## • A (parameter:cyl == 9000): 0 packets
## 
## • B (name == "data"): 3 packets
```

If you save this object you can explore it in more detail:

``` r
explanation <- orderly_query_explain(
  quote(latest(parameter:cyl == 9000)), name = "data")
explanation$parts$B
## $name
## [1] "B"
## 
## $str
## [1] "name == \"data\""
## 
## $expr
## name == "data"
## 
## $n
## [1] 3
## 
## $found
## [1] "20251219-120025-ba2aefbe" "20251219-120025-ca075289"
## [3] "20251219-120025-d8e20296"
```

(this would have worked with `rlang::last_error()$explanation$parts$A`
too).

You can also use `orderly_metadata_extract` to work out what values you
might have looked for:

``` r
orderly_metadata_extract(
  name = "data",
  extract = c(cyl = "parameters.cyl is number"))
##                         id cyl
## 1 20251219-120025-ba2aefbe   4
## 2 20251219-120025-ca075289   6
## 3 20251219-120025-d8e20296   8
```

### Filtering candidates in other ways

Above we saw two types of filtering candidates: `latest()` selected the
most recent packet while `latest(parameter:cyl == this:cyl)` found a
packet whose parameter matched one of our parameters.

We could have used `latest(parameter:cyl == 4)` to hard code in a
specific parameter value, and used
`latest(parameter:cyl == environment:cyl)` to match against whatever
value `cyl` took in the evaluating environment.

Instead of a query, you can provide a single id (e.g,
`20251219-120026-092ab356`), which would mean that even as new copies of
the `data` packet are created, this dependency will always resolve to
the same value.

You can chain together logical operations with `&&` (both sides must be
true) or `||` (either side must be true), and group conditions with
parentheses. In addition to `==`, the usual complement of comparison
operators will work. So you might have complex queries like

``` r
latest((parameter:x == 1 || parameter:x == 2) && parameter:y > 10)
```

but in practice most people have queries that are a series of
restrictions with `&&`.

### Computing dependencies and using many dependencies at once

One common pattern is the map-reduce pattern over a set of `orderly`
reports. With this, a set of packets are created over a vector of
parameters, or perhaps a chain of different reports for each parameter,
then they are all combined together. For some parameter `p` that takes
values “x”, “y” and “z”, this might look like:

        B(p = "x") -- C(p = "x")
      /                          \
    A - B(p = "y") -- C(p = "y") - D
      \                          /
        B(p = "z") -- C(p = "z")

So here, D will want to combine all of the three copies of the `C`
packet, one for each of `p` as “x”, “y” and “z”.

Especially if there are only three values and these are hard coded, you
might just write it out as

``` r
orderly_dependency("C", quote(latest(parameter:p == "x")),
                   c("data/x.rds" = "result.rds"))
orderly_dependency("C", quote(latest(parameter:p == "y")),
                   c("data/y.rds" = "result.rds"))
orderly_dependency("C", quote(latest(parameter:p == "z")),
                   c("data/z.rds" = "result.rds"))
```

Note here that in each call we vary the second argument to select a
different parameter value, and in the third argument we are naming our
destination file a different name (so we end up with three files in
`data/`).

You can write this out as a `for` loop:

``` r
for (p in c("x", "y", "z")) {
  orderly_dependency("C", quote(latest(parameter:p == environment:p)),
                               c("data/${p}.rds" = "result.rds"))
}
```

Here, in the second argument we use `environment:p` to fetch the value
of `p` from the calling environment - this is the looping value so will
take all three values. In the name of the third argument, we use the
special interpolation format `${p}` to substitute in the value of `p` to
build a filename.

## How dependencies interact with locations

By default, any packet that you have unpacked on your local archive is
considered a candidate for inclusion by
[`orderly_dependency()`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/reference/orderly_dependency.md).
This is not always what you want.

The locations that are selected, and the packets within them that are
considered as candidates can be controlled by the `location`,
`allow_remote` and `fetch_metadata` arguments to `orderly_run` (note
that the argument is to
[`orderly_run()`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/reference/orderly_run.md),
not to
[`orderly_dependency()`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/reference/orderly_dependency.md)
because this is an effect controlled by the *runner* of the report, not
the *writer* of the report):

- `location`: is a character vector of locations, matching your location
  names. Only packets that can be found at these locations will be
  considered. So if you have a mix of locally created packets as well as
  ones that other people can see, specifying `location = "server"` would
  limit to packets that are available on the server, which means that
  you will end up with dependencies that you colleagues would also get.
- `allow_remote`: controls if we are willing to download files from a
  location in order to satisfy a dependency. If `TRUE`, then when you
  run the report, it might download files if more recent packets are
  available on a location than what you have locally.
- `fetch_metadata`: only has an effect if `allow_remote` is also `TRUE`;
  this causes the metadata to be refreshed before dependency resolution.

There is further discussion of the details in
[`?orderly_run`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/reference/orderly_run.md)

## Other points

If you are used to systems like `targets`, it is easy to make reports
smaller than they need to be, and most users start by making their
`orderly` reports too small. There’s no real need to make these very
small, and picking the right size is a challenge.

If they are too small, you’ll end up writing a lot of code to
orchestrate running different reports and pulling things together.
You’ll end spending a lot of time about whether things are “up to date”
with one another because really a group of things always wants to run
together.

If they’re too big then you might end up doing more work than you want
to do, because in order to make a change to part of a piece of analysis
you must run the whole thing again.
