# orderly 2.0.0

* Initial release of the new orderly version.  Previously codenamed `orderly2`, this is a ground-up re-write of `orderly` based on feedback over the last 5 years.  See `vignette("migrating")` for details on moving from old versions of the package and the many differences between this version and the previous CRAN release.  Old projects can use [`orderly1`](https://vimc.github.io/orderly1/) to interact with old sources and archives.
