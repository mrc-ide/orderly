# You must ignore the .outpack directory from orderly (and you really
# should do this for any outpack project).
.outpack/

# orderly will create many files in drafts and ARCHIVE; these are also
# not suitable for version control. If you rename 
ARCHIVE/
drafts/

# You may store secrets etc in these files and they're special to your
# machine; they should not be committed:
.Rprofile
.Renviron
orderly_envir.yml

# Other R-specific files that accumulate that you don't generally want:
.Rhistory
.Rdata
.Rproj.user
