```{r, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

We use several options (set via R's `options()` system) to control some orderly behaviour.

To set an option for a session, you can use

```r
options(orderly.whatever = TRUE)
```

If you want to make this permanent, you can add this line to your `~/.Rprofile` file.  The easiest way to edit that file is to run `usethis::edit_r_profile()` which will find the correct file and open it in your editor (e.g., RStudio, if you are using that).

## `orderly.quiet`

Control verbosity of some informative messages.  If set to `TRUE`, then we suppress many of the `cli`-based chatty messages.

The option is `FALSE` by default, but it is `TRUE` in `testthat` tests, so that you should not need to suppress output manually.

## `orderly.index_progress`

Display a progress bar when building the orderly index (which can take a while on large archives).

This option is `TRUE` by default, but also affected by `cli`'s options `cli.progress_show_after` and `cli.progress_clear`.

## `orderly.schema_validate`

Validate all json produced by orderly using [jsonvalidate](https://docs.ropensci.org/jsonvalidate/).  This should be set to `TRUE` for people developing orderly (or orderly plugins) but `FALSE` otherwise.  The hope is that enabling validation at development will mean that all packets will conform to the schema, and then users will never want or need to worry.

This option is `FALSE` by default.

## `orderly.disable_orderly2_compat`

Disable loading of the `orderly2` compatibility mini-package, designed to help working with older sources that reference `orderly` as `orderly2` (see `vignette("migrating")` for details).

This option is `FALSE` by default, but will become `TRUE` in a future version as we deprecate the old format.

## `orderly.git_error_ignore`

Controls if we check the state of orderly's files within git.  Typically, we want to keep `.outpack` out of version control, but if this option is `TRUE` then the usual checks are suppressed.

This option is `FALSE` by default.

## `orderly.git_error_is_warning`

Controls if the error thrown for incorrectly version controlled `.outpack` files should be converted into a warning.

This option is `FALSE` by default.

## `orderly.interactive_parameters_missing_error`

Control if we should prompt for missing old-style parameters.  See `?orderly_parameters`; this is now deprecated.

The default for this option is `FALSE`.

# Environment variables

Orderly responds to the environment variables `ORDERLY_ROOT` and `ORDERLY_SRC_ROOT` which can control where the default option of `root = NULL` to most orderly functions looks.  This is semi-public; it is probably best not to rely on it, but we do use this ourselves to make the vignettes readable so it's likely to persist for a while.
