The new version of orderly (codename `orderly2` for now) is very different to the previously released version on CRAN (orderly 1.4.3; September 2021) or the latest development version of the 1.x line (orderly 1.6.x; June 2023).  These changes constitute a ground-up rewrite in order to bring out the best features we found that orderly enabled within workflows, while removing some features we felt have outlived their usefulness.  This is disruptive change.

This vignette is divided into two parts; one covers the conceptual differences between orderly and `orderly2` while the second covers the mechanical process of migrating from an existing orderly source tree and archive to take advantage of the new features.

If you have never used version 1.x of orderly, you should not read this document unless you are curious about the history of design decisions. Instead you should read the introductory vignette (`vignette("orderly2")`).

# Summary of changes

## So long YAML and thanks for all the whitespace errors

The most obvious user-facing change is that there is (almost) no [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), with the definition of inputs and outputs for a report now defined within an R script (`orderly.R`).  So an orderly report that previously had an `orderly.yml` file that looked like

```yaml
parameters:
  n_min:
    default: 10
script: script.R
source:
  - functions.R
resources:
  - metadata.csv
depends:
  raw_data:
    id: latest
    use:
      raw_data.csv: data.csv
artefacts:
  data:
    description: Processed data
    filenames: data.rds
```

would end up within an `orderly.R` script that looks like:

```r
orderly2::orderly_parameters(n_min = 10)
orderly2::orderly_dependency("raw_data", "latest", 
                             use = c("raw_data.csv" = "data.csv"))
orderly2::orderly_resource("metadata.csv")
orderly2::orderly_artefact("Processed data", "data.rds"))
source("functions.R")
```

We think this is much clearer, and comes with documentation and autocomplete support in most IDEs.

In fact, for simple reports, **no** special functions are required, though you'll find that some will be useful (see `vignette("orderly2")`)

### Implications

This change has widespread implications:

* you can program against things like dependencies, creating a for loop over a series of parameter values, or conditionally depending on other reports
* any R script can be the basis of an orderly report, and you can add orderly functions annotating inputs and outputs progressively

## Database support has been moved into a plugin

In version 1, we had built-in support for accessing data from SQL databases; this has moved within the [`orderly.db`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/orderly.db) plugin. All major features are supported.

## No more commit

## No more testing or development mode

## New, language-agnostic, backend

The biggest change, but perhaps the least visible, is that orderly is now built on an open spec [outpack](https://github.com/mrc-ide/outpack) which can be implemented for any language. We will develop a Python implementation of this.

This takes control of all 

# How to migrate

There are two parts to a migration; updating the canonical copy of your orderly archive (ideally you only have one of these) and updating your source tree. These steps should be done via the `orderly2outpack` package.

# What were the problems in version 1

* The YAML format is inflexible, error prone for users, and leads to duplication
* It was too focussed around our initial needs with the [Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium](https://vaccineimpact.org)
