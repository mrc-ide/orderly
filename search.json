However, sometimes want extract data order ask specific questions like: parameter combinations available across range packets? particular set packets used? files packets produce? Later like ask even complex questions like: version file graph.png change? inputs changed versions? ...able answer questions requires similar approach interrogating metadata across range packets. orderly_metadata_extract function aims simplify process pulling bits metadata arranging data.frame (sorts) .  little mini-language extract argument simple rewriting results, can always . order use function need know metadata available; expand vignette worked examples make easier understand. function works top-level keys, : id: packet id (always returned) name: packet name parameters: key-value pair values, string keys atomic values. guarantee presence keys packets, types. time: key-value pair times, string keys time values (see DateTimeClasses; stored seconds since 1970 actual metadata). present start end always present. files: files present packet. data.frame (per packet), columns path (relative), size (bytes) hash. depends: dependencies used packet. data.frame (per packet), columns packet (id), query (string, used find packet) files (another data.frame columns corresponding filenames upstream packet, respectively) git: either metadata state git null. given sha branch strings, url array strings/character vector (can zero, one elements). session: information session packet run (unstandardised, even orderly version may change) custom: additional metadata added respective engine.  packets run orderly, orderly field , list: artefacts: data.frame artefact information, containing columns description (string) paths (list column paths). shared: data.frame copied shared resources original name () name copied packet (). role: data.frame identified roles files, columns path role. description: list information orderly_description() human-readable descriptions tags. session: list information session run, list platform containing information platform (R version version, operating system os system name system) packages containing columns package , version attached. nesting makes providing universally useful data format difficult; considering files data.frame files column, list data.frames; similar nestedness applies depends orderly custom data. However, able fairly easily process data format need . simplest extraction uses names top-level keys:   creates data.frame columns corresponding keys, one row per packet. name always string, character vector, parameters files complex, list columns. must provide id; always returned always first character vector column.  extraction possibly return data locations (.e., allow_remote = TRUE given value location) add logical column local indicates packet local archive, meaning files locally. can rename columns providing name entries within extract, example:   , except parameters column renamed pars. interestingly, can index structure like parameters; suppose want value parameter x, write:   allowed packet parameters element list.
